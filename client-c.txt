**Task:** You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

//initialize product count integer variable
PRODUCT_COUNT = 0
BOOLEAN SCAN_INPUT = 0
//show START_CASE prompt
PRINT "START CASE? Y/N"
IF INPUT = Y
    set boolean START_CASE = 1
    else end

WHILE PRODUCT_COUNT < 50 && START_CASE = 1 && SCANNER_INPUT do
    PRODUCT_COUNT +2
        ELSE START_CASE = 0 do
            PRINT "ALL DONE!"
            PRODUCT_COUNT = 0
            START_CASE = 0
            end
